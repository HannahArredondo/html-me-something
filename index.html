		<h1> PHOTOGRAPHY IS SOMETHING I DO SOMETIMES </h1>

				<p> Over the last 6 months, I have learned a lot about photography. I honestly
				didn't know a thing about photography until I bought a Canon T4i from a friend.
				That was the motivation I needed to get the ball rolling. Since then I have
				learned what I enjoy shooting and what isn't my cup of tea. So far I know I enjoy 
				the subjects<a href="#pups">animals</a>and<a href="#sports">sports,</a>but I 
				also know I enjoy a<a href="#variety">variety.</a></p>

			<p class="subjects" id="pups"> <br>One of my favorite subjects is animals. I have learned to use Shutter
			Priority Mode since animals move around so much, it is necessary in order to get
			the subject in focus. A lot of my friends have dogs, so I will take photos for them. I would like to
			start doing more shoots with people and their dogs though. (Many people there is money in it... and 
			I like dogs.</p>

			<p class="subjects" id="sports"> I have also been learning a lot about sports photography. I have done a few
			shoots for KC Crew Sports, an intramural sports league here in Kansas City.	There
			was a big learning curve for this, but I finally feel more confident in my ability 
			to shoot sports. </p>

			<p class="subjects" id="variety"> Although I enjoy shooting these specific subjects, I really just enjoy taking
			photos of random objects, plants, people, walls, buildings, etc. I don't discriminate.</p>
