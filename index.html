				<p> Over the last 6 months, I have learned a lot about photography. I honestly
				didn't know a thing about photography until I bought a Canon T4i from a friend.
				That was the motivation I needed to get the ball rolling. Since then I have
				learned what I enjoy shooting and what isn't my cup of tea.  </p>

			<p class="subjects"> One of my favorite subjects is animals. I have learned to use Shutter
			Priority Mode since animals move around so much, it is necessary in order to get
			the subject in focus.</p>

			<p class="subjects"> I have also been learning a lot about sports photography. I have done a few
			shoots for KC Crew Sports, an intramural sports league here in Kansas City.	There
			was a big learning curve for this, but I finally feel more confident in my ability 
			to shoot sports.</p>

			<p class="subjects"> Although I enjoy shooting these specific subjects, I really just enjoy taking
			photos of random objects, plants, people, walls, buildings, etc. I don't discriminate.</p>
